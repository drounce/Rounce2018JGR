# Rounce_etal2018_JGR_DebrisThickness
This repository contains codes related to the flux divergence calculations and the MC-Ostrem inversion method for estimating debris thickness.
## Scripts:
### SampleCode_Ngoz_Melt_LERain_Bands_2010_2012.m
Matlab script containing the code that was used to derive debris thickness for Ngozumpa Glacier based on DEMs from 2010 and 2012.  The inputs required to run the code are all detailed at the start of the script.
### SampleCode_EmergenceVelocityNotebook.ipynb
Python notebook containing the code that was used to estimate the flux divergence (emergence/submergence velocity) for Ngozumpa Glacier based on surface velocity and ice thickness data.
